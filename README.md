# Welcome to the Reddit Post Statistics App

This app is a simple Reddit client that allows you to view posts from a subreddit (like "Blazor" or any other) and see some basic statistics about the posts. It simulates a real-world scenario where posts are being entered in. The app starts somewhere in the middle of the subreddit's history, updates until the beginning is reached, and then polls the site for new posts. This enables you to observe the changing statistics as posts are updated, along with detailed information about each post.

## Features

- View Reddit posts from any subreddit
- Get basic statistics about the posts
- Updates starting from the middle of the subreddit's history to the beginning
- Continuously polls for new posts
- Option to sort posts by most recent or most upvotes

## Please Note

Currently, Reddit is not supplying the 3 rate limit headers as they may have changed this recently. Rate limit code has been added, but the rate limit is set to 60 seconds to prevent the app from being blocked by Reddit. This is not ideal but allows you to see the app in action. I will continue to investigate this and find a solution. Thank you for your understanding.

## Feedback

I hope you enjoy this app and look forward to hearing from you soon.
